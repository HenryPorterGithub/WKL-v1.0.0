                <br>There is a collection of things, ideas, habits, mores
                <br>that are so
                <br>Ingrained
                <br>into the American psyche that
                <br>They have become like gods
                <br>To the spirit of America
                <br>A pantheon of things
                <br>So revered
                <br>So iconic
                <br>So inherent in the belief system
                <br>That they actually color American lives and a way of life
                <br>That is like no other life lived anywhere else.
                <br>That American experience is
                <br>Where almost every belief
                <br>is held with religious zeal.
                <br><br>
                <br>Here are some small gods-
                <br>Right is Might
                <br>Might is Right
                <br>MightyRite
                <br><br>
                <br>Guns
                <br><br>
                <br>Owning them
                <br>Collecting them
                <br>Showing them
                <br>Carrying them
                <br>Modifying them
                <br>Shooting them
                <br>Cleaning them
                <br>Loading them
                <br>Viewing them
                <br>Holding them
                <br><br>
                <br>The thing about those American guns
                <br>Where ever these guns are discharged
                <br><br>
                <br>Either at home
                <br>On the streets populated By an ethnic minority
                <br>At a school full of the nations lifeblood and future
                <br>In a double wide trailer home to substance abuse and failure
                <br>At a church where simple folk seek salvation
                <br>At a movie theatre where the masses seek self evaluation
                <br>In a house divided by strife and accusation
                <br>At a post office, an old fashioned trunk of the
                <br>Communication highway.
                <br>At a place of work where
                <br>Interpersonal communications
                <br>Have sunk so low that
                <br>Violence
                <br>Is echoing out like
                <br>Visual smoke signals
                <br><br>
                <br>Or offshore
                <br>In some shit hole
                <br>Way back where ordinary Americans don't go much
                <br>Directed toward people of a different nation
                <br>Who would give anything to be in the American nation
                <br>Living the American dream, with bellies too filled with processed junk
                <br>Consumers enjoying consumption for consumptions sake despite the Funk
                <br>Living the American dream, with hope for a brighter future
                <br>Living like a hip hop star
                <br>Living like a movie star
                <br>The aggressor, the winner, the mightier, the righter, the richer, the fighter
                <br><br>
                <br>Guns discharged
                <br>In some shit hole
                <br>Where people have
                <br>different skin tones and
                <br>Different gods and
                <br><br>
                <br>Different perspectives on
                <br><br>
                <br>Crime
                <br>Duty
                <br>Honor
                <br>Loyalty
                <br>Life expectancy
                <br><br>
                <br>But not different perspectives on
                <br><br>
                <br>Love
                <br>Generosity
                <br>Kindness
                <br>Peace
                <br>Children
                <br>Nourishment
                <br>Hopelessness
                <br>Fear
                <br>Loathing
                <br><br>
                <br>Wherever these god guns are discharged
                <br>You will be deafened by their terrible raucous roar.
                <br>Your mind will be filled with
                <br>fear
                <br>Fright and flight
                <br>Your body will flood with chemical adrenaline
                <br>So metallic in its taste that
                <br>You could think you are
                <br>eating bullets
                <br>Spitting bullets
                <br>Eating the gun
                <br>Swallowing the phallic protuberance
                <br>Tasting metallic as it slides along your tongue to your throat
                <br>The sound of gunfire and people screaming in fear and pain
                <br>The sound so loud your horror becomes an audible scale of terror
                <br><br>
                <br>Where ever these god like iconic American weapons are discharged
                <br><br>
                <br>Blood will flow
                <br>Skin will be ripped
                <br>Flesh will be torn
                <br>Blood will flow
                <br><br>
                <br>Surprisingly the blood smells metallic
                <br>As metallic as your adrenaline tastes
                <br>As metallic as the gun and its deadly ammunition
                <br>Hard and cold and unyielding
                <br>Strengthened by velocity
                <br>Ignited by verbosity
                <br>But
                <br>From whose authority?
                <br><br>
                <br>Lives will be shattered
                <br>Love will be annihilated
                <br>All sense and reason
                <br>Will be lost for that moment
                <br>And for many moments to come.
                <br>The blood that
                <br>Pools and
                <br>Spreads and
                <br>Darkens
                <br>Whatever surface it was spilled upon
                <br>Foreign or domestic
                <br>The pools of sticky darkening life blood
                <br>Represent for all humanity
                <br>The ceaseless iconic religious belief
                <br>That might is right.
                <br>To the victors go
                <br>The spoils of war.
                <br><br>
                <br>I have come to know that
                <br><br>
                <br>these spoils of war
                <br>that come to us
                <br>They come for us
                <br>They degrade us
                <br><br>
                <br>They claim the lives of returning soldiers
                <br>They claim the thoughts of random victims
                <br>They leave Love shattered deaf and bleeding
                <br><br>
                <br>These spoils of war
                <br>They come for us
                <br>They degrade us
                <br><br>
                <br>Weapons of war have
                <br>no place in civilised society
                <br>No place within civil discourse
                <br>No place within a modern mindset
                <br>No place in settling disputes
                <br>No place in settling scores
                <br>Weapons of war are
                <br>An outdated anachronistic sadistic consumer item
                <br>Another thing for you to
                <br>Own
                <br>Possess
                <br>Collect
                <br>Another distraction from real solutions
                <br>Another distraction from real complexity
                <br>Another distraction from real uncertainty
                <br><br>
                <br>Beware what you own or it can
                <br>Own you
                <br>Define you
                <br>Annihilate you
                <br>Silence you
                <br>Consume you
                <br>Subsume you
                <br>Dehumanise you
                <br>Beware what you own or it can
                <br>Own you
                <br><br>
                <br>Beware what you own
                <br>Because it can
                <br>Feed your fear
                <br>Feed your uncertainties
                <br>Feed your anger
                <br>Feed your hunger
                <br>Feed your revenge
                <br><br>
                <br>Beware what you own
                <br>Because it can
                <br>Feed your rage
