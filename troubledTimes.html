                <br>When you live in
                <br>Troubled times
                <br>You think it is an
                <br>Anomaly
                <br>But it is not
                <br>Times are always strange
                <br>And troubled
                <br>Some times are stranger
                <br>Than others but
                <br>All times reveal uncomfortable truths
                <br>As civilisation marches
                <br>Towards an unfurling
                <br>Change comes
                <br>Ideas and behaviours morph
                <br>Human nature has a troubled path
                <br>Evil intent, hurt and pain
                <br>Fear and loathing
                <br>The dark underbelly of
                <br>Man's inhumanity to man
                <br>Continually rears an ugly maw
                <br>There are casualties always
                <br>Blood flows and human lives
                <br>Are lost.
                <br><br>
                <br>Men and women of power
                <br>The cult of personality
                <br>The divisions of religion
                <br>Politics and prosperity
                <br>Those who are
                <br>Rich and poor divide
                <br>The limited earthly
                <br>Resources unevenly
                <br><br>
                <br>Men and women of power
                <br>Crow with belligerent delight
                <br>At their ill gotten gains
                <br>Young white American boys
                <br>Shoot dead their classmates
                <br>Police in America shoot dead
                <br>The innocent people of colour
                <br>Racism is about
                <br>Demonising the other
                <br>Divisive measures used
                <br>To keep a populace
                <br>Muzzled and confused
                <br>Obediently suffering
                <br>For the propping up
                <br>For the support of
                <br>Men and women of power.
                <br><br>
                <br>The power usually resides
                <br>With white men of European
                <br>Extraction.
                <br>Women, people of colour
                <br>Children all traditionally
                <br>Lead lives with little power
                <br>And less wealth. Christians sit
                <br>At the apex of power
                <br>But power ebbs as we
                <br>Learn to disrespect
                <br>Age old institutional power
                <br>And religion and politics.
                <br>As we evolve as a species
                <br>We accumulate knowledge
                <br>Slowly we limp along
                <br>Dragging some
                <br>Kicking and screaming
                <br>Towards our future.
                <br><br>
                <br>This bumpy march forward
                <br>Takes us through troubled times
                <br>Reprobates haul us back
                <br>Outliers propel us forward
                <br>Songs and art forms serve as
                <br>Social signals pointing forward.
                <br>Points of light as beacons to
                <br>Guide our way forward
                <br>Emotional strings and ties
                <br>Binding us to our
                <br>Collective unknown.
                <br>Truths and lies compete
                <br>And cajole and mark our
                <br>Human narrative.
                <br>We make false starts and false
                <br>Assumptions and take false
                <br>Actions. We hurt each other.
                <br>We help each other. Actions
                <br>And inactions. The dichotomy
                <br>Of life that pushes and pulls
                <br>The human race along
                <br>The rough terrain we must
                <br>Traverse as a species on this
                <br>March through time.
                <br><br>
                <br>Clarity is a rare thing
                <br>We are blinkered catching a
                <br>Rare brief glimpse of how things
                <br>Might be in a far off idealistic
                <br>Future. What will be the opposing forces then?
                <br>Good and evil
                <br>Pain and pleasure
                <br>Wealth and poverty
                <br>Known and unknown
                <br>Real and unreal
                <br>Sustainable insubstantial
                <br>Knowledge and ignorance
                <br>Right and wrong
                <br>Just and injustice
                <br><br>
                <br>If we do, as a species
                <br>Manage to find an
                <br>Equitable balance where
                <br>We can share our limited
                <br>Resources and steward our
                <br>Home planet, will we have an
                <br>Outlet for our baser natural
                <br>Impulses?
                <br>will we ever be
                <br>A species where illness and
                <br>Pain and horror and a
                <br>Shadow underbelly cease to
                <br>Exist?
                <br>Would we even want that outcome?
