                <br>The treacherous road
                <br>The treacherous mind
                <br>The treacherous life
                <br>The treacherous kind
                <br>The treacherous wife
                <br>The treacherous abode.
                <br><br>
                <br>Life is not kind.
                <br>Humans don't really mind.
                <br>Society feeds on the vulnerable
                <br>Injustice is the norm
                <br>Do you really think you're capable
                <br>Do you worry life is actually sustainable
                <br>Or do you worry that the
                <br>Emptiness and suffering and pointless march towards destruction
                <br>Is the true meaning for humanity
                <br>Purposeful destruction with small acts of kindness
                <br>Small sparks of humour glistening
                <br>In the darling seething mass of pointless evil.
                <br><br>
                <br>Treacherous is ever present
                <br>Treachery is just the norm
                <br>Treachery for fun
                <br>Treachery for gain
                <br>Treachery is pain
                <br>Treachery makes me numb
                <br>Treachery prevents my progress
                <br>
                <br>Mindless treachery
                <br>Treachery for fun
                <br>Treachery is pain
                <br>Treachery for gain.
                <br><br>
                <br>Abused, neglected, dead.
                <br>Trigger warning

                <br>The first signs of trouble
                <br>Hanging on, letting go.
                <br>Preemptive strikes.
                <br>Hurt and pain of rejection

                <br>Changed by our surroundings and
                <br>Unchanged by our surroundings.
                <br>Change is inevitable
                <br>Change is impossible
                <br>I fear connection, I yearn for connection
                <br>I despise connection
                <br>I adore connection
                <br>Those threads that hold our stability
                <br>Those invisible strands
                <br>Those gossamer threads
                <br>Weaving a web that is at the same time
                <br>Stronger than steel and weak as water.
                <br>The duality of iconic issues
                <br>The duality of life
                <br>The duality of Love
                <br>Who is due Love
                <br>Are was due anything in this realm
                <br>Or
                <br>Must we suffer and strive for every morsel
                <br>Hunting and gathering
                <br>Good and evil
                <br>Picking the poison along with a pittance of sustenance.
                <br><br>
                <br>The first hunters and gatherers lived and died by their choices
                <br>They died less if they consumed less
                <br>But
                <br>Choosing more can feed the tribe
                <br>Choosing well spelled continuity
                <br><br>
                <br>Exploitation

                <br>Ripping off the dressing
                <br>Picking off the scab
                <br>Looking at the wound
                <br>Impulsivity
                <br>Goo and puss
                <br>Blood and flesh
                <br>Raw and oozing
                <br>Curious and compulsive
                <br>What do you learn from this inner excavation
                <br>You can smell your mortality
                <br>You can visualise organic processes
                <br>You can imagine the breakdown
                <br>Of an intricate series of interactions
                <br>That can sustain a living organism.
                <br>You are faced with the rot of your seeming
                <br>Invulnerability, bolstered by your spark of life
                <br>Even as you know the steady decline to destruction.
                <br><br>
                <br>Your very own heart of darkness
                <br>Darkling sparkling degenerating compulsion
                <br>Inevitability
                <br>Instability
                <br>Incapacity
                <br>Inundation
                <br>Consternation
                <br>Justification
                <br>Imperfection
                <br>Finding a crouching pathway
                <br>Through the treacherous mass of vegetative
                <br>Entanglement.
                <br>When do you finally find this dark passage narrowing and constricting to the inevitable pressure point where no <br>forward progress is permitted.
                <br>Blocked in the canal within. Suffocated to extinction,
                <br>Without enough room to curl into the comfort of a feral position.
                <br><br>
                <br>Incredible
                <br>Inedible
                <br>Unsustainable
                <br>Unobtainable
                <br><br>
                <br>Distain
                <br>Complain
                <br><br>
                <br>I am unable to
                <br>Live or die
                <br>Slip or fly
                <br>Laugh or cry
                <br><br>
                <br>I am unable to live or die.
                <br>This is not living
                <br>This is the new normal
                <br>This has always been my normal
                <br>Lurking in the darkness
                <br>Buffered by youth
                <br>Buffered by the wants and desires
                <br>Of a voracious appetite that searches for the
                <br>Unobtainable
                <br>Now as the passage of time tears at the fabric of my being
                <br>I realise the utter pointlessness of the pain of life.
                <br><br>
                <br>Any changes to the slouching momentum of human society
                <br>Is too little, too late for me
                <br>The human suffering
                <br>The injustice
                <br>The inhumanity
                <br>That is the norm
                <br>Creativity is bankrupt in the face of societal pressure
                <br>As we as a species take one faltering step forward
                <br>We turn tail and with supreme cowardliness and malevolence
                <br>Run backwards towards the basest icons inherent in our nature.
                <br>That is the nature of the beast
                <br>We are the beast
                <br>Collectively we are an all consuming, all devouring, all destroying roiling tornado of
                <br>Destruction
                <br>To our own selves, to others, to the planet.
                <br>We are bent on mortal injury to the whole of the life force.
                <br>Mathematically, scientifically is this a force that can be destroyed?
                <br>Contained? Obliterated?
                <br><br>
                <br>What is left when we destroy the planet that sustains our physical bodies.
                <br>Where does the spark of creation that generated our species flash next?
                <br>Is it about to create a different species that can be sustained upon our detritus?
                <br>How long does that take?
                <br>What does that look like
                <br>Does the pattern repeat
                <br>Is the tipping point balanced
                <br>With the same fragility
                <br>The same demonic self destructive impulses?
                <br>Is that the mathematical force of certainty or does the momentum
                <br>Carry on towards a greater good.
                <br>Is suffering necessary. Is it the impetus?
                <br>Do all the little pricks and pains of each individual strand
                <br>Combine to form a cohesive vessels hurtling through the universe
                <br>Both blindingly quick
                <br>And destructively slow
                <br>Towards some sort of redemptive experience.
                <br>Probably not.
                <br>It looks to me like one bizarre mixture blitzing in a
                <br>Machiavellian machine
                <br>set on
                <br>The highest high.
