                <br>Grab her by the vulva
                <br>The Vagina cannot be grabbed
                <br>The Vagina must be penetrated blind.
                <br><br>
                <br>Karen Walker from tV's Will & Grace says
                <br>If your genitals are on the outside, you're hiding something on the inside
                <br><br>
                <br>That orange American who is currently sleeping occasionally and intermittently in the big old White House, was caught on tape saying he can grab women by the Pussy just because of the fact that he is perceived as rich and famous. Women all over America and in fact the world, joined together to march wearing pink pussy hats! And the media in its own form of garbled semantics, ignorant terminology, and Freudian slip sliding, stopped using the slang term Pussy
                <br> and started saying the V word....... Vagina!
                <br><br>
                <br>I say to you all tonight, here in this room, that the misuse of this V word has got to stop, and here's why....
                <br><br>
                <br>*The Vagina cannot be grabbed
                <br>The Vagina must be penetrated Blind.
                <br><br>
                <br>Why do we misuse the word
                <br>Vagina
                <br><br>
                <br>Vagina can be the
                <br>Devouring mother, a
                <br>Negative feminine archetype, a
                <br>Passage
                <br>Tube
                <br>Hole,
                <br>A hole like
                <br>the black hole of Calcutta, the black holes of deep outer spaces, the sink hole whose gaping maw has opened outside of Mar a Largo, the southern White House.
                <br><br>
                <br>Mankind must have
                <br>Blind faith
                <br>that inserting his member
                <br>will be a positive experience
                <br><br>
                <br>Mankind cannot
                <br>actually see, visualise with certainty, view with any clarity
                <br>what dangers are hidden within a vagina
                <br><br>
                <br>Vagina dentata
                <br>Lorena Bobbitt
                <br>Emasculation
                <br>Castration
                <br>Sexually transmitted diseases
                <br>Yikes!
                <br><br>
                <br>Masturbation
                <br>The Safest action, if you hold your own member and self stimulate. we see examples in the media, of Harvey Weinstein and Louis CK using self stimulation with an exposed member in plain view of desirable femininity. Fear, horror and humour are some of the possible reactions. Fear and horror could fuel excitement. The power of the penis to stoke mortal terror can feed into rape fantasies of power projection. Wow! I think hysterical laughing at the absurdity in the situation could elicit an opposite reaction, but none the less, the person masturbating in public is subject to much less risk than
                <br>The person who is penetrating blind.
                <br><br>
                <br>So why do we say
                <br>Grab a woman by the vagina?
                <br>
                <br>The vagina is a dark recess ,
                <br>not on view,
                <br>not projecting outside of the body
                <br>But
                <br>Internal
                <br>Protected
                <br>Mysteriously unlit
                <br>It can be explored by fingers, tongue and penis
                <br>But only if these body parts are
                <br>Inserted
                <br>Inserted into its mystery.
                <br><br>
                <br>The vagina is
                <br>A passage
                <br>A passage
                <br>from the internal world of femininity where
                <br>Cucooned and enveloped
                <br>Awash in amniotic fluid
                <br>Warmed and nourished by the mother
                <br>All wants and needs administered
                <br>Quietly muffled from the noise of a harsh external world
                <br>A passage
                <br>A tube through which
                <br>In natural childbirth
                <br>A human must travel to
                <br>Gain a life in this world
                <br>The Vagina is
                <br>A passage through
                <br>To a new beginning, another life.
                <br>The vagina
                <br>Accessed from the womb
                <br>through the cervical valve
                <br>Is the last terrain each of us must traverse
                <br>in our journey through birth.
                <br>Before we see the light.
                <br><br>
                <br>The vagina
                <br>The template for a Celtic passage grave
                <br>The first territory, virginal territory,
                <br>Uncharted yet charted,
                <br>Unknown yet known
                <br>Friction and stimulation
                <br>Within enclosed confines
                <br>Culminating in the orgasmic explosion
                <br>Directional evolution
                <br>A one way system for sperm
                <br>A channel to direct forward momentum
                <br>Into the warm moist cave of the uterus
                <br>Accessible only through vaginal
                <br>penetration
                <br>by the male member
                <br>on the path to CREATING life.
                <br><br>
                <br>But,
                <br>The vagina
                <br>Cannot be grabbed
                <br>It can only be blindly
                <br>penetrated
                <br><br>
                <br>The Vagina
                <br>where it's enveloping mystery is revealed only by touch.
                <br>Where We do not see its mystery,
                <br>Where we cannot hear any vocalisation
                <br>Where it's taste can only be ascertained
                <br>by the tip of an injected tongue
                <br>Scent is an alluring attractant
                <br>that reveals nothing of the
                <br>Treacherous mystery of
                <br>The vagina.
                <br><br>
                <br>WHAT can be grabbed on the female anatomy
                <br>in the lower regions
                <br>After limbs and breasts and buttocks,
                <br>what can actually be handled in a GRAB?
                <br><br>
                <br>The vulva,
                <br>that other v word.
                <br><br>
                <br>The mons, the labia major and minor, the clitoris
                <br>The gateway to the vagina
                <br>If any one is grabbing anything
                <br>It sure is not the vagina
                <br>Unless they are using digits,
                <br>A single digit, or two slim ones at best.
                <br>No ham fisted person can grab a hold of a
                <br>vagina!
                <br><br>
                <br>The vulva
                <br>is designed to be cupped and caressed by the human hand
                <br>The vulva is the home to that collection of nerve endings
                <br>Where stimulation can explode into orgasmic pleasure
                <br><br>
                <br>Those parts of female genitalia
                <br>The Vulva
                <br>can be grabbed
                <br>But
                <br>The Vagina?
                <br>No way, no sir, no way Jose, not in this world, not on my watch, not in this universe
                <br><br>
                <br>The Vulva can be grabbed
                <br>The vagina must be penetrated BLIND
                <br><br>
                <br>While a male member is in blind penetration,
                <br>slipping and sliding to a glorious conclusion,
                <br>that sucker is
                <br>Enveloped
                <br>That Envelopment
                <br>in a Vagina
                <br>is one very vulnerable position
                <br>For such a temperamental
                <br>and precariously disarmed appendage.
                <br><br>
                <br>There must be faith,
                <br><br>
                <br>blind faith, blind penetration
                <br><br>
                <br>There must be
                <br>Faith
                <br>that no invisible enemy will
                <br>Immediately wound this
                <br>vulnerable engorged fragility
                <br>Faith
                <br>That no microscopic enemy
                <br>will emerge from the dark moist hollow
                <br>To wreak havoc for years to come
                <br>On health and future abilities.
                <br><br>
                <br>Are we
                <br>As a society
                <br>Misusing the word
                <br><br>
                <br>Vagina
                <br><br>
                <br>Are we misusing the word
                <br>because it is a word
                <br>That describes a place
                <br>So monumental in its
                <br>Importance to
                <br>Human procreation
                <br>So mysterious in its
                <br>Protected interior position
                <br>So dark and hidden and moist and uncertain
                <br><br>
                <br>Are we misusing the word
                <br>because it is a word
                <br>The describes a place
                <br>That men fear
                <br>But
                <br>A place
                <br>That men must
                <br>Penetrate
                <br>In order to procreate?
                <br><br>
                <br>Vulva
                <br>A word we need to
                <br>Insert into daily speech
                <br>Vulva Not Volvo
                <br>That's a car
                <br>That is male
                <br>A car can drive into a garage
                <br>A car can drive into a tunnel
                <br>A Volvo is made of steel and
                <br>Hard plastics and strong carbon fibres
                <br>A car is a metaphor for
                <br>Strength and virility
                <br>A car can represent a penis
                <br>But
                <br>When we use a car to represent a penis
                <br>We are endowing this penis with traits and characteristics
                <br>That are clearly and evidently
                <br>Lacking in a penis.
                <br>The human penis has no bone
                <br>Only a fragile skin
                <br>Covering a blood swollen mass of
                <br>Flesh and nerve endings
                <br>The penis is

                <br>When we substitute

                <br>Pussy
                <br>We really mean

                <br><br>
                <br>Are we using

                <br>Because it is a word
                <br>For a place

                <br>So powerful
                <br>So magical

                <br>That when we use it erroneously
                <br>It is In order to

                <br>In order to
                <br>Sublimate the very terror?
                <br><br>
                <br>Is there shaming in its naming?
                <br>Do we name to shame?
                <br>Do we misnamed to contain?
                <br>I think we do.
                <br><br>
                <br>The Vulva is not a car.
