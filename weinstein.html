                <br>Beeswing
                <br>Steen or stine
                <br>Which pronunciation is reviled less.
                <br><br>
                <br>Remember
                <br>Beeswings.
                <br>Weinsteins
                <br>Beestings.
                <br><br>
                <br>A name now repugnant in the public domain
                <br>Once lauded, like all heroes
                <br>Elevated and then sent crashing to
                <br>The ultimate sacrifice
                <br>The god of wine has a long history of sacrifice
                <br>Sacrifice after debauchery
                <br>Bacchanalian and operatic in its
                <br>Emotional scope
                <br>Intoxication, wine sodden rompings of lust
                <br>A hero chosen from the pack of mortals
                <br>Disfigured to mark him as their king
                <br>Lauded over a period of hedonistic pleasure seeking
                <br>And then sacrificed,
                <br>brought down on an alter of significance
                <br>Sacrificed for the greater good
                <br>Sacrificed for the sake of a future harvest
                <br>Where all will be enacted again, in another ghastly play
                <br>Revisited annually like the rites of spring
                <br>The Bacchus king crowned, revered and sacrificed
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced, repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>So it seems the Weinstein family name
                <br>Was acquired from the family profession
                <br>Practiced in Old Gallicia
                <br>Which in all actuality was
                <br>peddling a by product
                <br>Of the wine industry.
                <br>rampant anti semitism meant
                <br>Obscure niches within the market system were
                <br>exploited and monetised
                <br>By the marginalised
                <br>Repeated. Scripted. Danced, repeated.
                <br><br>
                <br>So this odd distillate
                <br>A white crystal salt
                <br>Was gathered and sold on
                <br>Sold on as Weinsteins
                <br><br>
                <br>Also called beeswings.
                <br>It came from an organic source
                <br>A humble fruit, the grape
                <br>But this salt could never get you high
                <br>Could never get you drunk
                <br>This salt could be ground down
                <br>To a white marching powder
                <br>And dissolved in a weak acid, like vinegar
                <br>another by product of the industry
                <br>Vinegar is merely Wine gone bad!
                <br>Take these two common refugees from
                <br>The alcoholic world
                <br>Mix them together and
                <br>Whammo
                <br>A handy dandy cleaner
                <br>A diabolical pot scrubber
                <br>Useful on copper and brass and steel or aluminium
                <br>Water that mixture down and slight stains
                <br>On porcelain can be lightened.
                <br>Applied like a poultice
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated.
                <br><br>
                <br>What about stained reputations
                <br>Are bad reputations scrubbable?
                <br>Can the carbon residue of cooking up
                <br>interpersonal relationships replete with
                <br>Bullying and predation
                <br>Debasement and Subjugation
                <br>Fear and loathing
                <br>Ever to be scrubbed clean?
                <br><br>
                <br>I don't think
                <br>This namesake of
                <br>This byproduct
                <br>Can use beeswings
                <br>To erase the stench,
                <br>The encrusted residue of hate
                <br>The tell tale ring of discolouration.
                <br><br>
                <br>I think he's playing
                <br>The waiting game
                <br>Out in Arizona
                <br>Supposedly getting counselling
                <br>As an outpatient,
                <br>With dinners at public restaurants
                <br>Where diners are free to
                <br>Come and smack him upside his head.
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated.
                <br><br>
                <br>There is no knocking any sense into a man
                <br>Who has
                <br>Long used his personal power
                <br>Long used power projection
                <br>To wield a heavy hand
                <br>Subjecting each ingenue to
                <br>Unwanted sexual activity.

                <br>There is no knocking any sense into a man

                <br>Similarly scripted acts
                <br>Over and over again
                <br>For decades.
                <br><br>
                <br>Enabled and propped up with
                <br>Injections of viagra and colleagues
                <br>Who pimped for this dastardly scenario.
                <br>These moments were not part of any movie
                <br>They were not theatre for popular consumption
                <br>These dark moments
                <br>Fuelled by fear and
                <br>Unimaginable discomfort
                <br>Almost unendurable and
                <br>Exquisite in their cruelty,
                <br>These dark moments were
                <br>repeated, scripted, danced and repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>Like a bad porn loop
                <br>That plagued him and played him
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>The paraphernalia, the accoutrements
                <br>Prescriptions filled and vials emptied
                <br>Into hypodermic syringes
                <br>Liquid hard ons
                <br>Injected subcutaneously
                <br>So this Beeswing of a man
                <br>Could terrorise fragile femininity
                <br>And conquer her eternal mystery.
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced repeated

                <br>Talk about eating the WHOLE cow
                <br>This alcoholic industry
                <br>Uses every last thing for monetary enrichment.
                <br>Waste not want not
                <br>These precipitations, these crystals born out of
                <br>Fruit juice, flock to
                <br>The bottom of the barrel
                <br>Sometimes sticking to the walls,
                <br>sometimes adhering to a cork
                <br>Especially if the wine is stored
                <br>Cold, like revenge at
                <br>Under 10 degrees Celsius .
                <br>Resembling the detached flying apparatus
                <br>Of the planet's preferred pollinator
                <br>These wings broken from the body
                <br>Wafting down through the liquid brew
                <br>Some sticking to solid surfaces
                <br>Some floating to settle
                <br>In heaps strewn across
                <br>The bottom of the barrel.
                <br>Weinsteins
                <br>These salty rocks
                <br>These poor mans diamonds

                <br>KC4H5O6
                <br>A potassium acid salt
                <br>With a molar mass of 188.177
                <br>Of
                <br>Tartaric Acid which is a
                <br>Carboxylic acid.
                <br>When used in baking we call it
                <br>Cream of Tartar, but
                <br>that's another poem for sure,
                <br>Where I will wax poetic about
                <br>Egg whites frothed into meringues
                <br>And cream whipped to lofty heights
                <br>Both sweet concoctions desired
                <br>By every pallet.
                <br>This magical detritus of wine
                <br>It dissolves in any acid,
                <br>This salt, this Weinstein, this beeswing.

                <br><br>
                <br>The white crystals can be ground down to
                <br>The white powder You can purchase
                <br>in a small glass jar at your grocery
                <br>It dissolves in any acid
                <br>Acids make salts?
                <br>Acids dissolve salts
                <br>Chemistry is a tricky science
                <br>All that mixing and transmography
                <br>Changing and combining
                <br>Distillation and precipitation
                <br>Those covalent bonds broken and reformed
                <br>Creation,
                <br>Chemistry is creation on a

                <br>These crystals rarely
                <br>dissolve back into wine
                <br>It's a one way street.
                <br>Filtered, desalted, unfermented
                <br>Grape juice can be boiled down
                <br>As Heat is applied
                <br>As the liquid evaporates
                <br>A new substance is created
                <br>A substance that is thicker and sweeter
                <br>And more cloying
                <br>It becomes a substance that can be spread.
                <br>A similar emollient is created within the beehive
                <br>It is created to feed the Queen
                <br>To nourish her so that
                <br>She can create more beeswings.
                <br>In the hive we find Royal Jelly
                <br>On your stove at home
                <br>You will be making grape jelly.

                <br>But the beeswings remain
                <br>That precipitate is an extra
                <br>That can be sold on for profit
                <br>Those beeswings are Weinsteins.

                <br>When they are in their crudest form, their natural state
                <br>They have a lovely diminutive slang
                <br>They are called

                <br>Those hedonistic days are not that far behind us
                <br>We hold the collective memory
                <br>For archetypes
                <br>We can all revert to archetypes
                <br>It's ever so easy to
                <br>Re enact a cultural taboo
                <br>It happens every day
                <br>It has not been the kind of crime, historically,
                <br>That can easily be criminalised
                <br>Hard to prosecute
                <br>She said, he said
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>Many tried to bring him to book
                <br>Many tried and all failed
                <br>It took a sea change
                <br>It took a cultural seismic shift
                <br>It took the straw, that last straw before
                <br>The camel broke
                <br>How long had we been sick of being sick
                <br>It took an orange orangutan of a sexual predator
                <br>To ascend the highest pinnacle,
                <br>the loftiest seat of power in American society
                <br>Twenty maidens accuse him of sexual predation
                <br>But he is unassailable
                <br>He is teflon coated for now,
                <br>So, we collectively attack a softer target
                <br>A beached whale of an excuse for a man of power.
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>We start to hear about Weinstein
                <br>The salacious stories start to rain down
                <br>Like flakes of salts within a cask of wine
                <br>He is attacked by media savvy maidens and media savvy crones
                <br>They each have an iconic media presence
                <br>They are comely, articulate, known,
                <br>They start to stand together
                <br>There is a safety in numbers
                <br>Their stories become familiar because of their shared details
                <br>Their stories of debased humiliations
                <br>Their stories of sexual assault
                <br>Start to be really heard
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>A movement is formed and
                <br>Voices around the world are raised
                <br>And white flowers are held and
                <br>Gang colours are paraded blackly to
                <br>Flourish on red carpets where once
                <br>Starlets were clothed in glittering gowns
                <br>Fashioned by the emaciated pale young wife
                <br>Of this whale of an ogre who
                <br>Terrorised an industry of lights
                <br>And magical fantasy into his own
                <br>Personal limp dick driven horror show
                <br>Of pornography
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>Over and over again.
                <br>Like the crystal salts of his surname
                <br>Endlessly precipitating out of
                <br>A magical transformative process
                <br>Into a vat of intoxicants.
                <br>What's in a name you ask?
                <br>Everything is in that name
                <br>The hero, the maiden,
                <br>The villain and the very
                <br>Act of defilement
                <br>A heinous act
                <br>Repeated, scripted, danced and repeated
                <br><br>
                <br>Spirit driven, risen
                <br>Given a surname
                <br>That will now be forever
                <br>Associated with a
                <br>Vile act of aggression
                <br>A tale as old as time
                <br>A tale that has an emblem
                <br>Beeswings
                <br>Broken from the body
                <br>Of an essential pollinator
                <br>Beeswings
