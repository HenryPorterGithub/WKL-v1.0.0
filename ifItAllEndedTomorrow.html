                <br>If it all ended tomorrow
                <br>I wouldn't mind a bit
                <br><br>
                <br>Realistically speaking
                <br>Reality is a shadow of the mind
                <br>I think, I feel, I eat and sleep
                <br>I am here for such a short stay
                <br>Sometimes it feels as though
                <br>Time passes interminably slowly,
                <br>But in all actuality time speeds
                <br>Past in record time.
                <br>I have used medications to cope
                <br>With this passage of time
                <br>They help me process the
                <br>Passage. 42 years ago I
                <br>Visited Dowth and Knowth.
                <br>I rubbed the entrance stone and
                <br>Traced the circular paths carved
                <br>Into the stone. I gave that rubbing
                <br>Away immediately because the
                <br>Time I spent on the process
                <br>Taught me all I needed to know
                <br>To follow the map of my life as
                <br>It unfolded before me in time. The
                <br>Love I journeyed with, to that knowing,
                <br>Has recently been released from this
                <br>Time. I am old now and often I long
                <br>For oblivion. I have crammed a lot of
                <br>Living into this time. Experiential activity
                <br>I have loved lost and left, crowed with joy
                <br>And cried with loss and pain and hate.
                <br>I have been noisy and I have often spoken
                <br>In haste. I have acted and reacted with
                <br>Supreme ignorance. I have accumulated
                <br>An inordinate amount of knowledge but
                <br>For a clever girl, I have been incredibly
                <br>Stupid and selfish. I have also been
                <br>Loyal and fiercely true and loved with
                <br>Passion. I have known so many wise
                <br>And accomplished individuals. I have
                <br>Burned so many bridges. I have inspired
                <br>And led many an individual to some
                <br>Wild and weird revelatory knowing.
                <br>I have pissed off a lot of people. I have
                <br>Not led a simple quiet life. If it all
                <br>Ended tomorrow I wouldn't mind a bit.
