                <br>Proof evident
                <br>Presumption great
                <br>Concern, worry, care
                <br>Inclination
                <br>Determination
                <br>Consternation
                <br>Ghost town
                <br>Stumbling
                <br>Earth shattering nightmare
                <br>No emotion behind the words
                <br><br>
                <br>Dig a hole
                <br>Shallow for the grave
                <br>Deeper for his lies
                <br>Deeper and deeper
                <br>For a fiction he created
                <br>A made up story
                <br>Deception calculation
                <br>Past tense used
                <br>Before they are found
                <br>A tell
                <br>A lie
                <br>A past tense
                <br>Forgetting and
                <br>remembering
                <br>Rising pitch
                <br>Vanished family
                <br><br>
                <br>A cleaned house
                <br>Where dogs scent
                <br>The terrible truths.
                <br>Every fan was set on high
                <br>The smell of cleaning
                <br>Products was cloying
                <br>The carpets wore tracks
                <br>Of the path of the vacuum.
                <br>His slight of hand was too
                <br>Obvious.
                <br><br>
                <br>Eye contact
                <br>Crossed arms
                <br>Hugging his body
                <br>Rocking to self soothe
                <br>Trying to remember
                <br>His lies
                <br>Guilty
                <br><br>
                <br>Two days of lies
                <br>To the world, a
                <br>Media sensation
                <br>Admission of guilt
                <br>Dump location
                <br>revealed
                <br>Decomposition
                <br>With skin slippage.
                <br>A foetus found excreted
                <br>Into her underpants.
                <br>Dirty sheets that wrapped
                <br>Her buried body, entered
                <br>Into evidence.
                <br><br>
                <br>The narcissistic psychopath
                <br>Confesses his guilt to avoid
                <br>The death penalty, in a state
                <br>Where no one is ever put to
                <br>Death. Cops a plea.
                <br><br>
                <br>Authorities believe the
                <br>Children were murdered before
                <br>Their mother returned. Scent
                <br>dogs alerted to the bed in the
                <br>Unfinished basement. She left her
                <br>shoes at the door, her purse on a
                <br>Table in the kitchen and her cell
                <br>Was found shoved under cushions
                <br>In the upstairs lounge. She wore
                <br>Only her underwear. Buried in a
                <br>Shallow grave with a sheet from
                <br>Her bed. All soiled with dirt and
                <br>Excrement and blood. The mixtures
                <br>of death
                <br><br>
                <br>There is shock and dismay that
                <br>This man deceived so well
                <br>So long, with no real emotion.
                <br>He lived within a family unit
                <br>And passed. We rake over the
                <br>Details available in cyberspace,
                <br>Looking for clues, red flags
                <br>Logical conclusions for
                <br>Illogical psychopathy.
                <br>Compound lies and too
                <br>Virulent a protest from
                <br>His mother, denigrating
                <br>His dead wife. There are secrets
                <br>Hidden from his family. The true
                <br>Nature of his pathology remains
                <br>Unbelievable to those who claimed
                <br>This monster as their own. Truths arise
                <br>Revealing his deviant sexual
                <br>Desires, satisfied by illicit activities
                <br><br>
                <br>He smothered his children and
                <br>Strangled his wife, with his bare hands.
                <br>He tried to play it smart
                <br>with lies proclaiming innocence,
                <br>when he would have been better
                <br>Served saying nothing and
                <br>Finding a lawyer.
                <br>The overriding poverty mindset he
                <br>Was raised with, never prompted
                <br>Him to lawyer up. After his confession,
                <br>His father thought to mention it.
                <br>Proof evident.
