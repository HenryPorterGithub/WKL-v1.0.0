                <br>Often, when I am low on meds
                <br>I have a bit of a verbal tic.
                <br>I can rage with the best of them.
                <br>Sometimes I am quite horrified
                <br>By the scorched earth these tics
                <br>Seem to leave, as if I draw on the
                <br>Psyches of those near and dear
                <br>With charcoal of my own making.
                <br>Process art, and it is never kind and
                <br>gentle and loving and wrapped up
                <br>Like a box of chocolates. It is
                <br>Often perceived as full on war fare.
                <br>Fear and loathing does that to me.
                <br>I allow my emotions to get on the
                <br>War path. That is one of the
                <br>Benefits of SSRI's, they increase
                <br>Your emotional IQ and extend time
                <br>In order to give me that counting moment
                <br>Where you are supposed to take a deep breath
                <br>and wait before you launch in to an
                <br>Atomic detonation. I am amazed at
                <br>People who use strategy and serve revenge cold.
                <br>That has never ever been my style even
                <br>Though I admire it in others. I am a hothead.
                <br>I can be mean and cruel. When I wait, my rage
                <br>only builds to boil over scalding myself as
                <br>Well. My emotional intelligence on medication
                <br>Enables me to see the nuances of others reactions
                <br>Leaving me to actually often take no offence.
                <br>Feelings, hurt feelings, bad feelings, these are
                <br>My triggers that produce my tics. Emotional
                <br>Turrets. My tics are not random outbursts of
                <br>Forbidden words. My tics are sharply honed
                <br>to inflict maximum damage and are site specific
                <br>for vital organs and the jugular. These tics
                <br>are designed to make an Opponent bleed
                <br>out and I am not after a slow bleed. No
                <br>I am after a gusher, a fountain spray of
                <br>Lifeblood so I know for sure I have a hit.
                <br>I am not at all happy about my tics. I
                <br>Never think of them as an asset. I think
                <br>they are some vestigial expression
                <br>my ancient ancestors needed in order to survive.
                <br>What earthly good would these verbal missiles
                <br>have been to a hunter gatherer? Why would
                <br>early man have needed verbal sparring skills?
                <br>No mastodon was stopped in its tracks by
                <br>A scathing reference to its moral character.
                <br>Mid evil knights were not in the habit of
                <br>Using verbal criticism to win a joust.
                <br>Perhaps in a cave, in order to ramp up ones
                <br>rank, a rant about a rivals poor loyalty
                <br>Could accelerate a rise. During a barter
                <br>session perhaps you could intimidate in
                <br>Order to get a better deal and to warn against
                <br>Shady crooked behaviour. Who knows. More
                <br>Often that not a mouth like mine would
                <br>probably get you killed. I would have died from a
                <br>burst appendix in ancient times and without the help
                <br>of forceps I would surely have died in childbirth.
                <br>So why do I come with a temper and a mind full
                <br>Of tricks and tics? I have no idea. I know that no act
                <br>of will on my part can stem the tide of my anger
                <br>Nor the outburst of verbal tics. Like a tantrum or an
                <br>orgasm there is no stopping the train that
                <br>Has left the station. My tics act like sentient beings
                <br>with a mind of their own. Within me, part of me,
                <br>yet set apart and travelling on a set of tracks
                <br>That veer off beyond my peripheral vision to
                <br>Attack and cause maximum damage. They are
                <br>Like a nuclear Missile programmed with a set
                <br>Of coordinates. Like lightening these tics
                <br>Are formed and fired. Almost instantaneous.
                <br>My mind finds the soft underbelly and
                <br>formulates a series of words, phrases, concepts,
                <br>Denigrations, insults, criticisms,
                <br>hurtful observations, lethal confirmations
                <br>Seriously hateful substantiation of all that
                <br>Is wrong with the other. All that has ever been wrong
                <br>with the other and all that is ever likely to be
                <br>Wrong in the future. There is always a litany
                <br>And a detailed history of every single transgression
                <br>Word or deed, thought, imagined or acted out.
                <br>Tics are specific, never sporadic.
                <br><br>
                <br>Everything I know about my world
                <br>Internal and external is provisional
