            <p class="poemBody">
                One of my first attempts at suicide was as a nine year old standing at a porcelain sink in a Toronto department store called Simpsons. I had stolen money from my maternal grandmother, a crisp twenty dollar bill. I purchased a large bottle of 222s, powdered and cast codeine. I was skipping school after an orthodontic appointment. I was a child tasked with using complicated public transit, train, subway, streetcar, and bus changes to attend an appointment of pain and agony. My mother worked and would never have considered it her place to accompany me or schedule these visits on a Saturday when she would be free. This tooth straightening had been my own idea. To me it was self evident that there was a problem since my unexpanded jaw left room for a full compliment of teeth only if they were positioned in a tangled jumble at right angles to the normal position of teeth.
                <br><br> Everything hurt in my world. The pain of dissolving a human living jawbone in order to reposition teeth into a more photogenic order, was merely a physical manifestation of an emotional burden I carried for my difunctional extended family. There was a whole pantheon of palpable pain going on in my world. The wreckage of my parents marriage, the terrible PTSD my father carried home from the Second World War, the clearly unhappy marriages of both sets of grandparents, and my clever older sisters toes sporting chronically festering ingrown nails, these were all the backdrop to my childhood universe of pain and disfunction.
                <br><br> Two years earlier my teacher had sent home a note for my single parent. Buy this girl a book. As a toddler an aunt returning from England had given me my one and only volume, a picture book about a rabbit with wings who was cared for, along with other forest misfits by Belinda, the woodcutter's daughter. We did own a set of the encyclopaedia Britannica housed in its own made to measure bookcase. The pages were ultra thin and packed with information I devoured and regurgitated like a performing chimp. This was not literature and I had no verbal narrative for my acquired knowledge, but I had a voice and I had projection and I must have been very hungry for attention, being a latch key kid. I used to stand up in class and spout ridiculous and unrelated facts that had sparked my imagination. I was never ever on topic.
                <br><br> In the eyes of my maternal grand parents, in whose home we were living, my sister and myself were evil incarnate. We were other. We carried genetic information from another tribe. We were the reason for our mothers fall from grace, the reason for her broken marriage, the reason for her socio economic strife, the reason she had lost her looks, the reason she might be unhappy, the reason she could not connect, the reason she had become who she now was, a person they simply could never comprehend.
                <br><br> These grandparents were not young, they were not educated, they were not clever, they were not kind. Books? They read a newspaper most days! This house was in their opinion, literate, even though in terms of emotional IQ they were in all reality functionally illiterates.
                <br><br> Since my second grade teacher had taken the trouble to send home a missive, my mother and I walked to the candy variety store down on Lakeshore Road. Previously I had often been sent there alone, palming a nickel. Five cents to buy penny candy. Three black balls for one cent. Each black ball could be slowly dissolved in your mouth, layer under layer to a tiny grain that might or might not have been organic.
                <br><br> This time we spent 99 whole cents and came home with a four inch by four inch bright peacock blue volume of, "Little Black Sambo". When I proudly displayed this treasure at school for show and tell, this blond haired teacher virtually rolled her eyes and announced that, that, was not what she had had in mind. Miss Campbell just might have been a paragon of understatement.
                <br><br> This book was far below my reading standard but I think the politics of a colonial mindset and the abuse, degradation, cultural appropriation, subjugation and outright theft spoke to the kind of childhood I was experiencing. My worth as a person was valued about as much as poor Sambo. Instead of spending time with her children, my mother spent every waking hour not in work, locked away in her parents dining room sewing clothing. With disdain and discipline, with averted attention, my tiger adults were stealing my innocence and my youthful promise and clothing themselves to appear more than. They were chasing each other around that tree of life until they metaphorically melted into a liquid butter, amber that I would use to flavour the pancakes of my future life.
                <br><br> As I stood at that cold white sink, gulping water to swallow pill after pill, I caught the gaze of a woman in the mirror. She signalled disapproval. I do not remember any words but I knew, that she knew, that what was happening here was not a good thing. She had no dog in this race, no available recourse other than that signal. Nothing was done, she left, and I continued to eat codeine like candy.
                <br><br> It didn't work because over 61 years later I still yearn for oblivion through external actions.
