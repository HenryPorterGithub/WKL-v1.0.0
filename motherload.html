                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who said she never wanted children
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who always put her needs first
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who changed with the wind
                <br>Every thought, need, desire and belief
                <br>Coloured by the
                <br>Company she kept
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who was never ever there for you
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who resented any trait
                <br>That reminded her of your father
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who minimised your feelings
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who could not comprehend
                <br>Your personal trajectory and
                <br>In that incomprehension
                <br>Could not guide, support or cheer
                <br>Any accomplishment
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Who repeated that she never ever wanted children
                <br>You could end up with an adult like me.
                <br><br>
                <br>When you have a mother
                <br>Like mine
                <br>Who raised a child
                <br>like me
                <br>You grow up fantasising
                <br>What it would be like
                <br>To be raised by wolves
                <br><br>
                <br>You grow up wondering
                <br>What it would be like
                <br>To be raised
                <br>By any wild creature.
                <br><br>
                <br>I became obsessed by natural history
                <br>The physical features
                <br>The natural habitats
                <br>The eating and mating habits
                <br>The fur and feathers
                <br>That clothed these wild things
                <br>The enveloping covers
                <br>Their distinguishing features.
                <br>The flora and fauna of the natural world
                <br>Fascinated my mind. I was searching
                <br>For an anthropomorphic answer to
                <br>My childhood pain. I was searching for
                <br>Precedent for my becoming. I was
                <br>Searching for a roadmap.
                <br>I believed that by understanding
                <br>The flora, fauna and terrain of the
                <br>Natural world, I could decipher
                <br>From these clues, a way to
                <br>Navigate the emotional terrain
                <br>Of my familial realm. Although I
                <br>Can spout endless facts and bits of
                <br>relevant information on the natural world
                <br>This knowledge brought me
                <br>no closer to understanding the wounds
                <br>Inflicted by my narcissistic parent nor my
                <br>Absent father.
                <br><br>
                <br>My understanding comes from living
                <br>In the world of human nature.
                <br>It is a harsh world where the human
                <br>Intellect has conjured tricks of tragedy
                <br>And mans inhumanity. The human world
                <br>Makes a sport of inflicting pain and humiliation.
                <br>As a species we seem more than well endowed
                <br>With an ability for desecration, a
                <br>Global destruction that encompasses all.
                <br><br>
                <br>My mother might have been a
                <br>Particularly malevolent force in my world
                <br>But her sociopathy is repeated and
                <br>Rewarded within all society.
                <br>She was not alone, not singularly an aberration.
                <br>In evolutionary terms, the need for the
                <br>Forces exerted by such personalities has
                <br>Propelled us as a species. As apex
                <br>Predators we are not warm and fuzzy.
                <br>It is a harsh world we fight in
                <br>Harsh geography, harsh weather systems,
                <br>Harsher inequalities, harsher consequences
                <br>Harsh realities colour our existence.
                <br>How we learn to traverse this plain is a
                <br>Conjunction of our experiences,
                <br>our intellect and our emotional fortitude.
                <br>We are more than the sum total of our
                <br>Life experiences. We add to this our
                <br>Ability to reflect and conjure new meanings
                <br>Which we place upon our battle scarred
                <br>Being. We assimilate and regurgitate
                <br>A more nuanced being who has
                <br>Experienced both
                <br>good and evil
                <br>Pleasure and pain
                <br>Ease and disease
                <br>Loss and gain.
                <br><br>
                <br>If we survive the motherload
                <br>Some of us live
                <br>Too tell the tale.
