        <h1 class="poemTitle"> Ditches </h1>

        <div class="wrapperPoemBody">
            <p class="poemBody">
                <br>Little gullies, broad sumps
                <br>Hollows where debris collects
                <br>Gutters sluicing waste
                <br>Trickles gathering combining
                <br>Gaining momentum
                <br>Tumbling along.
                <br>Gravity is a rather pure
                <br>force. A constant we live
                <br>With, take for granted
                <br>And then we fall.
                <br><br>
                <br>Can you imagine eternity
                <br>Clinging to the thing that killed you?
                <br><br>
                <br>Ditches are remarkable
                <br>I have leapt over broad ones
                <br>On the back of a snorting
                <br>Hunter. Brought up breathless
                <br>By a sudden view of Gatwick,
                <br>A new backwards view, the
                <br>Ass end of a transportation
                <br>Nightmare blighting the
                <br>Landscape. There was no
                <br>forewarning from that broad reach.
                <br>As unexpected as the safe flight
                <br>That view was shocking and
                <br>Thrilling as I found my geographic place.
                <br><br>
                <br>In my neighbourhood the ditches are ,
                <br>planted with hedges and filled in so
                <br>That flooding occurs with each repetitive rain.
                <br>Dependable as clockwork. They say that
                <br>Ditches are only good for falling into.
                <br>How very english, I think.
                <br><br>
                <br>Drainage is not uppermost in the English
                <br>Mentality. The first time I took the Chunnel
                <br>Train I marvelled at the sudden appearance
                <br>Of deep channels, drains, the moment
                <br>Daylight broke through on the french side.
                <br>Miles and miles of them. Such a wondrous
                <br>sight, such ingenuity, such forethought.
                <br>My first year in England was wet, sodden,
                <br>flooded beyond recognition. Swans sailed
                <br>Past the tip tops of park benches. Many
                <br>Roads impassable for months. Towns
                <br>unapproachable for want of a ditch or two.
                <br>Very crazy for a land of rain whipped
                <br>in from the sea, a land where forecasting
                <br>the weather remains a hilarious exercise
                <br>In fortune telling. I come from the new world
                <br>Where my inland home made a forecast as
                <br>dependable as the man who flipped his chalk
                <br>on black and white television for families
                <br>With boomer children.
                <br><br>
                <br>Culverts, sized appropriately and connected
                <br>To the correctly sized ditches allow drainage
                <br>These systems are proven
                <br><br>
                <br>When I lived in Chennai the flooding was horrific
                <br>Even though the monsoon failed to arrive.
                <br>They have never built a ditch or a drain since the
                <br>British left, but they have filled in the
                <br>Wetlands with garbage and built a silicon
                <br>Valley next to the Bay of Bengal. With each rain
                <br>The urine of rats and cats and dogs and humans
                <br>And monkeys and cows Is mixed with the open
                <br>defecation of all these Species and stands stagnate
                <br>in the road, for want of a system of drains.
                <br><br>
                <br>Eventually it all evaporates or finds a way to trickle
                <br>To the sea with the help of gravity. In the meantime
                <br>We wade through, slosh through the toxic brew.
