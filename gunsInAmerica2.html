                <br>When people say guns don't kill people
                <br>People kill people
                <br>People with guns kill people
                <br>It is a rare kind of truth
                <br>That avoids knowledge of
                <br>a societal logic
                <br>A logic, a lexicon
                <br>That would restrict
                <br>Ownership
                <br>Within a consumer world
                <br><br>
                <br>Where owning things is an addiction
                <br>Where buying things is an addiction
                <br>Where collecting things is an addiction
                <br><br>
                <br>Addiction within a consumer driven society
                <br>Is necessarily approved
                <br>to fuel the cash transaction
                <br>The ever ratcheted climb towards a
                <br>Receding pinnacle
                <br>Arching away from view
                <br>Into stratospheric clouds
                <br>That obscure the shrouded finish line
                <br>Because this finishing line
                <br>The tape racers breach upon completion
                <br>Is never ever obtainable
                <br>This vanishing point is fiction
                <br>Eventually this fantasy of rampant acceleration
                <br>Falls to pieces
                <br>Shattering into countless shards
                <br>Eventually the capitalistic dream disintegrates
                <br>Monopoly money
                <br>The bubble bursts, the curtains part
                <br>The hollow consumptive addiction
                <br>That drove this tired beast
                <br>Limitless consumption of finite resources
                <br>Has consumed its host and
                <br><br>
                <br>As values and aspirations redirect
                <br>And change course, the American
                <br>Fascination with gun ownership
                <br>Dries up, becomes unfashionable
                <br>The flagging appetite empties the pond
                <br><br>
                <br>As the world suffocates
                <br>under the weight of its own detritus
                <br>People rethink the relationship between
                <br>Consumption and possession
                <br>Scaling down appetites,
                <br>Evening the field of play
                <br>Living sustainably with equality
                <br>Sharing Money and resources equitably
                <br><br>
                <br>IS A consumer driven capitalistic society
                <br>Hell bent on never restricting gun ownership
                <br>Doomed to be subsumed and consumed
                <br>Self devoured like the serpent feeding on its own tail?
                <br>That is the pertinent question, the question for all Americans
                <br>When one nation at its pinnacle of strength and world domination
                <br>Foments wars around the globe, mostly in regions not easily
                <br>Accessible to its tourist class,
                <br>Therefore safely beyond a daily newscast
                <br>When this nation exports war mongering through
                <br>Outright aggression and through the sale of the weapons of war
                <br>When this nation allows each individual citizen
                <br>the inalienable right to bear arms
                <br>At home, when this nation allows its officers of the law to
                <br>Kill
                <br>without provocation
                <br>without recrimination
                <br>When citizens are shot by toddlers with their own personal hardware
                <br><br>
                <br>When people say guns don't kill people,
                <br>People kill people
                <br>Where does it end?
                <br><br>
                <br>I hope it ends with world peace and an intolerance
                <br>To arm the citizen.
                <br>I hope it ends with world peace and abundance
                <br>shared equitably.
                <br>I hope it ends in world peace coupled with
                <br>sustainable practice
                <br>I hope it ends in world peace and a renewed interest in knowledge
                <br>And education.
                <br><br>
                <br>Restrict gun ownership
                <br>Restrict the consumer driven society
                <br>Replace capitalism with socialism
                <br>Guns do kill people
                <br>People with guns do kill people
                <br>Competition for limited resources
                <br>Breeds disrespect.
                <br>Restrict disrespect.
                <br>Restrict weapons of war
