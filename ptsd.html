                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nose bleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>I'm a child of the fifties
                <br>I'm a baby boomer
                <br>I was fathered by a man
                <br>Who navigated bombers and
                <br>sighted and timed the
                <br>Ejection of bombs
                <br>Over Europe
                <br>Their destruction fell
                <br>like a premature ejaculation
                <br>Raining fire and brimstone
                <br>On the poor souls who
                <br>Had the misfortune of
                <br>Calling these once civilised realms home.
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nosebleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>These poor people
                <br>Their worlds were obliterated
                <br>They were left homeless with only
                <br>Rubble and mayhem
                <br>Dust and destruction
                <br>Shattered and bleeding
                <br>Battered into submission.
                <br>He bombed Dresden
                <br>Over and over again
                <br>He bombed Dresden
                <br>into an oblivion
                <br>That made the Stone Age seem civilised.
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nose bleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>He came home from war
                <br>Still so young and naive
                <br>So wet behind his ears
                <br>He came home and
                <br>Married and sired two children
                <br>He came home broken
                <br>To a world that had
                <br>No name for his affliction
                <br>He flew a record number of missions but
                <br>He was ill prepared to face
                <br>The singular destruction
                <br>His mind and hands had wrought.
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nosebleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>He sought religious redemption
                <br>Within the Church of England
                <br>He donned a red red robe and covered that
                <br>With a Snow White surplice
                <br>He processed up the church aisle carrying
                <br>One tall tall stately candle, an acolyte to the man
                <br>Who was called to represent god to his parishioners
                <br>The man who had a direct line to god
                <br>Through prayer.
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nosebleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>Those prayers were never answered
                <br>In a photograph taken in 1953
                <br>At a family christening for my young cousin
                <br>My father stares out at the camera lense
                <br>Clearly mad, totally bonkers, obviously not
                <br>Coping with a psychotic episode, manic.
                <br>We were living with his parents
                <br>That was not a happy home
                <br>Each night I was awoken by a stranger
                <br>Who ran naked and screaming through the house
                <br>It was a tiny house
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nosebleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>Upon my shocked awakening each night
                <br>I sat and saw the red red blood
                <br>That had escaped my body through my nose
                <br>Staining the white white sheets
                <br>Adding a new dimensional pattern
                <br>To the teddy bears that adorned my pyjamas
                <br>White white tissues were forced
                <br>against my nose to staunch the
                <br>Red red blood that flowed.
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nose bleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>My parents were building a house
                <br>It was a yellow house with a
                <br>black roof and a black door
                <br>It nestled into an elevation in the landscape
                <br>Snuggled into a hill
                <br>A cowboy gunslinger sitting
                <br>With his back against a wall.
                <br>It was never a happy home
                <br>Those night terrors continued
                <br>For an additional three years
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nosebleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>The running and the screaming
                <br>And the blood staining my sheets
                <br>Sitting in the harshly lit bathroom
                <br>With white tissues jammed against
                <br>My bleeding nostrils
                <br>These were all a regular occurrence
                <br>Regular like clockwork
                <br><br>
                <br>My father had PTSD
                <br>I had gusher nosebleeds
                <br><br>
                <br>Finally in desperation and
                <br>For a myriad of reasons
                <br>My mother
                <br>Packed her two young girls
                <br>And fled to her parental home
                <br>It was 1957
                <br>Fall was turning its head to regard winter
                <br>This home was never a happy home either
                <br>But, there were no night terrors
                <br>The beast that stalked our family
                <br>Remained with the shell that was my father
                <br>Years would pass without a glance at
                <br>This mysterious and enigmatic figure.
                <br>I never ever heard him scream again
                <br>I never ever saw him run naked anywhere again
                <br>I never had another nose bleed
                <br>Go figure
