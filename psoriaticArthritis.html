                <br>I am a self consumer
                <br>I am a shedder
                <br><br>
                <br>Shedding skin cells
                <br>Forming pustules
                <br>Devouring my own connective tissue
                <br>Devouring ligaments tendons
                <br>muscles and their attachments
                <br>Devouring the cartilage supporting bones
                <br>Forming spherical reservoirs
                <br>of yellow synovial fluids
                <br>That have leaked from capsules
                <br>surrounding my articulation points
                <br><br>
                <br>Everywhere I go
                <br>A flurry
                <br>A flutter
                <br>A blizzard
                <br><br>
                <br>A harmattan
                <br>A deluge
                <br>A dust devil
                <br>A duster

                <br>A Samiel
                <br>A sirocco
                <br><br>
                <br>A sandstorm
                <br>A tsunami
                <br><br>
                <br>An avalanche
                <br>Of shed skin
                <br>carpet bombs my world.
                <br><br>
                <br>The normal human sheds
                <br>3 kilograms of skin each year
                <br>These discarded cells
                <br>These bits of dust we shed
                <br>Are the diet of a microscopic minion called the dust mite.
                <br>We co-exist with these 8 legged creatures
                <br>Who have been here longer than humans
                <br>In a weird And largely unacknowledged reality
                <br>We farm them, mostly without consent or even knowledge.
                <br><br>
                <br>The normal bed houses
                <br>ten thousand dust mites.
                <br>The weight of your mattress
                <br>doubles every ten years
                <br>Simply because of the weight of the
                <br>resident dust mite infestation.
                <br><br>
                <br>Each individual dust mite
                <br>Lives for merely six weeks
                <br>And a female lays over 50 eggs.
                <br>Those microscopic mites that feed on
                <br>Human detritus
                <br>Must have hit the mother load
                <br>When they enter my orbit
                <br>I am one endless smorgasbord
                <br>Of deliciousness
                <br>I have probably increased the world mite population
                <br>Ten fold in the last fortnight.
                <br><br>
                <br>Those little mites are chowing down on my
                <br>Old skin and procreating like crazy
                <br><br>
                <br>Yellow pustules explode on my
                <br>Palms and heels}
                <br>Silver scaly patches appear over my entire body
                <br>Silver because the skin is detaching in death and
                <br>Taking on the ghostly appearance of all discarded skin
                <br>Before it joins the blizzard
                <br>The blizzard that is shed
                <br>escaping my personal magnetic orbit
                <br><br>
                <br>Some people are only affected on
                <br>hands and feet
                <br>Knees and elbows
                <br>Scalp and tailbone
                <br>My first huge and undeniable signal
                <br>started on my palms
                <br>They were covered with pustulating wounds
                <br>That reminded me of bleeding stigmata
                <br>Ripped from some statue in a
                <br>Dank cold church
                <br>With Christ portrayed
                <br>Around the 13 stations of the cross
                <br>Of course I immediately related it to Christ
                <br>We all have a Messiah complex
                <br>Now that we have been initiated
                <br>Into the jungian world
                <br>Thanks be to Russell Brand.
                <br>But I was sporting
                <br>A physical manifestation of something
                <br>So obvious
                <br>So debilitating
                <br>So disgusting
                <br>So painful
                <br>both
                <br>Physically and psychologically
                <br>That I personally
                <br>Could not deny
                <br>My significance
                <br>My godlike persona
                <br>Considering the archetypal
                <br>Nature of my affliction.
                <br><br>
                <br>The slow steady march of these pus laden blisters
                <br>And silver scaling islands
                <br>Were interesting to map.
                <br>Intriguing were the expanses of afflicted flesh
                <br>Why would it attack the sweaty area just under my breasts?
                <br>Why my scalp? Oh god, not my face!!!
                <br>My ankles, my heels, the soles of my feet.
                <br>Early on there were many diagnoses. From contact dermatitis
                <br>To a simple, I don't know!
                <br>This from trained professionals in greater London and Milan.
                <br>When the general practitioner in Surrey finally
                <br>got a look at my entire body covered in
                <br>Psoriasis
                <br>he knew he was finally on to a diagnosis!
                <br>Out came the cameras, out came the lights!
                <br>Call in the colleagues for a good old google
                <br>Action!
                <br>Now wait six months to visit a specialist in Rheumatoid Arthritis and a Dermatologist!
                <br><br>
                <br>Not much help at the hospital in Guildford.
                <br>Each visit saw me introduced to a new locum
                <br>A new stand in for the specialist I was sent to see.
                <br>And the history, the litany, was transcribed anew
                <br>Like that movie Groundhog Day.
                <br>Nothing advanced but
                <br>Like all the good scribes of bureaucracy
                <br>Notes were taken.
                <br><br>
                <br>I moved to India,
                <br>A psoriatic pilgrim
                <br>I became what has now been termed a
                <br>Medical tourist
                <br>Except I was not a tourist
                <br>But
                <br>the spouse of an architect
                <br>Who was hired as a technical advisor
                <br>For the construction of,
                <br>get this,
                <br>The worlds tallest and largest statue.
                <br>One colossally gigantic golden man
                <br>Facing a dam on the holy Narmada river in Gujarat, north India.
                <br>Twenty some years before, my husband, the MainMan,
                <br>Had Worked on the restoration of the Statue of Liberty.
                <br>Perfect qualifications for the construction
                <br>of an object one hundred times larger
                <br>In a third world crocodile infested backwater
                <br>Where workers climb bamboo scaffolding in bare feet
                <br>And have no personal knowledge of a hard hat.
                <br><br>
                <br>The irony was not lost on me!
                <br><br>
                <br>While living in the south of India,
                <br>Old Madras, or
                <br>Chennai as it is now called
                <br>I found a wonderful specialist
                <br>Who had spent 15 years in England
                <br>Developing his expertise in this obscure
                <br>Auto immune disorder.
                <br>I became afflicted with a seemingly local disorder
                <br>Chennai Eye!
                <br>Really conjunctivitis causing lesions and inflammation.
                <br>A marker for Psoriatic arthritis.
                <br>Then, in an act of
                <br>mythic and archetypal proportions
                <br>I was bitten, on the sole of my foot,
                <br>But a small red fire ant.
                <br>This event took place
                <br>Within the holy confines
                <br>Of a sacred Hindu temple
                <br>You do know they make you remove your shoes
                <br>and walk around incredibly filthy places
                <br>Unprotected from the excrement of
                <br>Roosters, temple monkeys and holy cows.
                <br><br>
                <br>The power of the venom
                <br>Of that tiny creature
                <br>Sent my body into
                <br>Some sort of cataclysmic shock
                <br>Reeling I succumbed to the doctors ministrations
                <br>That were more akin to a religious calling.
                <br><br>
                <br>He and his father run a clinic in the city
                <br>The father treats paediatrics
                <br>The son auto immune Arthritis
                <br>Clients come from all over India
                <br>They are seen by these Brahmans,
                <br>Tirelessly and for no payment.
                <br>As a rich foreigner I was charged the equivalent of
                <br>Five American dollars.
                <br>Over the span of two years
                <br>My condition was controlled
                <br>And the quality of my life
                <br>Has improved immeasurably.
                <br><br>
                <br>Two years in to my return from
                <br>The Indian sub continent
                <br>I again am sporting skin lesions
                <br>As my body attacks and consumes
                <br>my Achilles' tendons
                <br>I have pustules that burst and bleed
                <br>Causing my heels to flake shedding
                <br>Damaged skin like a snake.
                <br>My body is attacking my finger joints
                <br>This baby finger is leaking
                <br>Joint fluid into a cyst like capsule.
                <br>My fingernails are ridged like an old washboard
                <br>My exhaustion is limitless
                <br>As I despair with flu like symptoms
                <br>There is the pain of swelling joints
                <br>And the crippling stiffness that accompanies these
                <br>Swellings.
                <br><br>
                <br>Could be worse, I like to tell myself.
                <br>Do you know what people with my condition
                <br>Really need to avoid?
                <br>Perfume!
                <br>When Fragrance
                <br>Comes in contact with the humans largest organ
                <br>The Skin
                <br>A chain reaction is ignited
                <br>A chain reaction akin to a
                <br>Nuclear detonation.
                <br>Like the bite of a fire ant
                <br>Perfume is a venom that sets
                <br>Reactions alight.
                <br><br>
                <br>Soaps contain perfumes and drying agents that can be toxic!
                <br>Personal hygiene in a world of blizzards of
                <br>Shed skin cells. Imagine that.
                <br>Personal hygiene without perfume or soap.
                <br>In the modern consumer driven capitalist society
                <br>The sale of hygiene products is
                <br>The holy grail of monetary Armageddon.

                <br>Of dandruff
                <br>Carpeting my world and
                <br>Feeding microscopic mites.

                <br>Surviving in nature is

                <br>My mites, my minions
                <br>Need no glue to keep me near

                <br>On our planet.
                <br>Sporting eight legs
                <br>They are related to spiders and scorpions.
                <br><br>
                <br>There are probably more than 5 million different species of mites.
                <br>They are found everywhere and on everything
                <br>Animate and inanimate
                <br>The Smithsonian museum in Washington DC
                <br>An acquisitive collector in a nation of
                <br>Compulsively addicted collectors,
                <br>Has only a mere 10 thousand images of different mite species.
                <br>Ten thousand out of five million.
                <br>This array of Americas Most Wanted
                <br>Is missing the majority of its hit list.
                <br>To successfully photograph these relatives of arachnids
                <br>They must be first frozen in liquid nitrogen
                <br>And then viewed under a microscope with at least a
                <br>10 times magnification.
                <br>A scanning electron microscope does a better job.
                <br><br>
                <br>The tiniest mite recorded is in length only
                <br>One third the width of a human hair.
                <br><br>
                <br>If anyone here has ever looked up close and personal at their split ends, you have an idea of how small that really is.
                <br><br>
                <br>82 microns long!
                <br><br>
                <br>We as a species are
                <br>Relatively oblivious to
                <br>These tiny free loaders,.
                <br>These mites with
                <br>eight legs And a voracious appetite
                <br>for our personal detritus'
                <br><br>
                <br>Some of these minions are relatively benign
                <br>Fitting into the pantheon of nature like
                <br>Statues into niches
                <br>Doing gods work.
                <br>But
                <br>Sometimes these mites carry viruses
                <br>That wreak havoc on the world.
                <br>Site specific cataclysms that can affect crops and
                <br>Cause world wide devastation sight unseen
                <br>Sometimes the mites cause human allergic reactions
                <br><br>
                <br>The house dust mite
                <br>Demartophagoides farina
                <br>De mart oh fah gee oy dees fah ree nah
                <br>Is one of only
                <br>A select few
                <br>Currently with Identification,
                <br>That are chowing down
                <br>in our habitable spaces.
                <br>Classed as Non-parasitic.
                <br>These microscopic eating machines are
                <br>Feeding at the banquet table of my
                <br>blizzard of shedding skin.
                <br><br>
                <br>This mite in question
                <br>Lives in
                <br>Humid
                <br>Room temperatures
                <br>In and on
                <br>Habitats like
                <br>My mattress
                <br>My pillow
                <br>My carpet
                <br>And any other surface within my home
                <br>That has access to the detritus of my human body.
                <br>Floors, walls, ceilings, counters, tables, desks, chairs, lamps, couches, clocks, TVs, phones,Toasters, towels, sheets, blankets, frying pans, plates and cutlery.
                <br>You name it
                <br>If it's in my home
                <br>A mite is CAMPING there.
                <br>But in my case
                <br>Because of the tsunami of shedding skin
                <br>My affliction affords,
                <br>My mites are GLAMPING!
                <br>They are gorging at my banquet of personal DNA.
                <br>You are what you eat?
                <br>They are me.
                <br>They have become
                <br>more me
                <br>than me!
                <br><br>
                <br>Although relatively benign
                <br>Millions of people do suffer from an allergic response to the
                <br>Excrement of dust mites.
                <br><br>
                <br>So, you might not be allergic to your own dead skin
                <br>But
                <br>After a dust might has eaten
                <br>Your dead skin cells
                <br>After a dust mite has digested
                <br>Your dead skin cells
                <br>This dust mite then
                <br>Excretes a new substance
                <br>Made out of your substance
                <br>But now changed
                <br>Transmogrified into
                <br>Something
                <br>you
                <br>Very possibly
                <br>can become highly allergic to.
                <br>The irony.
                <br><br>
                <br>Demodex folliculorum
                <br>Is a mite that lives on your face.
                <br>Well it "lives all over your body
                <br>But
                <br>It especially likes my
                <br>Nose, my
                <br>Eyebrows, my
                <br>Eyelashes.
                <br><br>
                <br>This mite likes to live in
                <br>Those little pockets around hair follicles
                <br>Rich in oozing oils.
                <br>Ground zero,
                <br>Home to millions!
                <br>A very desirable post code!
                <br>After dark
                <br>These night crawlers
                <br>An estimated million and a half strong
                <br>Come out to feast on residue clogging each hair.
                <br>But feasting at your banquet table is not all they do!
                <br>The blighters are at a banquet, a party!
                <br>These guys are getting down!
                <br>Like most party animals they fuck.
                <br>They are feasting and fucking all over your body
                <br>Having a jolly old time of it
                <br>And pooping! They are taking
                <br>A gigantic collective shit on you to boot!
                <br>Imagine that in your next living nightmare of a life.
                <br><br>
                <br>These mites are not considered harmful
                <br>They don't usually, always,
                <br>Trigger an immune response.
                <br>Under normal circumstances
                <br>your immune system categorises
                <br>These mites as
                <br>Part of you!
                <br>You. They are what they eat
                <br>They eat you
                <br>They are you.
                <br><br>
                <br>These mites are passed from parent to child
                <br>If you analyse the DNA of your own mites
                <br>You can track
                <br>Geographically
                <br>Your personal familial origins over time
                <br>And over the course of generations.
                <br>Your family and their geographic origins are
                <br>Contained within the DNA of the
                <br>mites living on your skin.
                <br><br>
                <br>If someone with my affliction
                <br>Shedding billions of skin cells
                <br>Chooses to remain anonymous
                <br>It proves impossible
                <br>Because
                <br>Each skin cell containing
                <br>My particular DNA
                <br>And the DNA of the
                <br>Microscopic mites
                <br>That live on my body
                <br>And on my shed skin cells
                <br>These combined DNA markers
                <br>Can track me
                <br>And the actual geographic locals
                <br>Of me and my ancestors.

                <br>Mites like Demodex folliculorum
